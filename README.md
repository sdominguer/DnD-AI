# Welcome to DnD-AI!


Each year, 10 million Dungeons and Dragons sessions are created, but did you know that more than half of these cannot take place due to a `lack of a Dungeon Master?` Dungeons and Dragons is a game that relies entirely on the imagination of its players, and among them, the Dungeon Master is `the one who creates the story` the players will follow, develops characters, their abilities, monsters, maps, and items – essentially, `the heart of the game`. We depend heavily on them, and there isn't always someone willing to take on the role.

What if we replaced them with an `artificial intelligence` that is available at all times? One that allows you and your friends to play a quality session whenever you want, `generating the map and enemies` automatically. That's us, DnD-AI, and we want to offer you this new way of playing – much more focused on immediate gameplay and with a faster pace.

Unlike similar ideas, we have various visual enhancements, such as `real-time map` visualization and the `generation of images` for the epic scenes that, until now, you could only imagine.

## To run *(do the pip install if it's your first time running the project):*

```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
python manage.py runserver
```

## Software requirements

- Python 3.12.X (3.11.X and below are not supported)
- The needed dependencies and libraries defined in requirements.txt. To get them, run ```pip install -r "requirements.txt"```

## AI usage requirements

- For image generation is needed either a `OpenAI API key` or a `HuggingFace API key`.  
- For action interpretation, storytelling and campaign's info providing, a `Google Gemini API key` is needed. OpenAI GPT option will be re-added in the future.

You can provide this keys either creating a file called `api_keys.env` on the root dir of the project.

```
# api_keys.env
# on root dir of the project

openai_api_key = 
hf_api_key = 
gemini_api_key = 
```

Or a file called `API.py` on `/DnD_AI/` (the application, not the project). At the same level of `functions_AI.py`, the file that uses the api keys.
```
# API.py
# on same folder as /DnD_AI/functions_AI.py

openai_api_key = " "
hf_api_key = " "
gemini_api_key = " "
```

In any case, `the game is still playable with some (or none) of the API keys`. While AI generated images being replaced with placeholder images and action inputs not being interpreted, but supporting the use of commands instead.
